## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Hello everyone! Here is a frontend project I worked on comprising of Javascript, JSON, Fetch, HTML and SASS/CSS. This project is part of the Frontend Mentor program which focuses on improving user's coding skills. All designs were created by them and this time rather than being involved with the UX/UI design, I focused purely on all coding aspects for the work.

Thank you! :)
